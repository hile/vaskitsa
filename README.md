# Vaskitsa developer helper tools

This module contains some utility classes for programmers. These classes can
be used mainly for automation, including

* git commit data utilities for automation
* python project and module structure code generation
* sphinx code documentation generation

This is very much work in progress, so please don't expect this to much yet.

## Naming vaskitsa

The name vaskitsa comes from Finnish word for slow worm which looks like a
snake but is not: like this module is mainly for python developers but in
the end not really.
